# Linked List Cycle

Given `head`, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

A cycle exists if a node in the list can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer.  
Return `true` if there is a cycle, and `false` otherwise.

| Example   | Input                        | Output  | Explanation                                    |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Example 1 | `head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1` | `true`  | The tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed). |
| Example 2 | `head = [1,2], pos = 0`      | `true`  | The tail connects to the 0th node.             |
| Example 3 | `head = [1], pos = -1`       | `false` | There is no cycle in the list.                 |
