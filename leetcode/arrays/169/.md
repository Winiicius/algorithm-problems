# Majority Element

Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`, return the **majority element**.

The **majority element** is the element that appears **more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times**.  
You may assume that the majority element **always exists** in the array.

| Example   | Input                    | Output | Explanation                                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Example 1 | `nums = [3,2,3]`         | `3`    | The number `3` appears twice, which is more than ⌊3/2⌋ = 1.   |
| Example 2 | `nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]` | `2`    | The number `2` appears 4 times, which is more than ⌊7/2⌋ = 3. |

### Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10⁴`
- `-10⁹ <= nums[i] <= 10⁹`
